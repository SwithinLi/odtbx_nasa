 What is the OD Toolbox? <br />
 The Orbit Determination (OD) Toolbox is an orbit determination
 analysis tool based on Matlab and Java that provides a flexible 
 way to do early mission analysis.  Its primary design features are 
 the following. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * The Toolbox is primarily intended for advanced mission analysis such
 as might be performed in concept exploration, proposal, early design
 phase, or rapid design center environments; the emphasis is on
 flexibility but it has enough fidelity to produce credible results.
 <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * Insight into all flight dynamics source code is always provided.
 <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * Matlab is the primary user interface, and is used for piecing together
 measurement and dynamic models.  The Java Astrodynamics Toolbox is used
 as an engine for things that might be slow or inefficient in Matlab, like
 high-fidelity trajectory propagation, lunar and planetary ephemeris
 lookups, precession, nutation, polar motion calculations, ephemeris file
 parsing, etc. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * The primary analysis functions are sequential filter/smoother and batch
 least-squares commands that incorporate monte-carlo data simulation,
 linear covariance analysis, measurement processing, and plotting
 capabilities at the generic level.  These functions have a user
 interface that is based on that of the Matlab ODE suite. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * To perform a specific analysis, users write Matlab functions that
 implement truth and design system models.  The Toolbox provides a set
 of object-oriented measurement and dynamics class libraries that give the
 user the ability to build up arbitrarily complex models through
 inheritance from simpler ones.  Using this library of basic classes
 can help to avoid having to make a major software change to the base
 system every time something new comes up.  However, users are always free
 to use these or not. The user provides his or her models as inputs to the
 filter commands. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * With the object-oriented libraries, there is an an option for
 network-based modeling to simplify the creation of arbitrarily complex
 aggregations of objects, e.g. a multi-spacecraft formation interacting
 with multiple gravitational bodies with a variety of different
 interspacecraft and ground-to-space measurement types. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * The Toolbox provides limited automation capabilities such as:
 frequently used functions and constants in the Matlab taskbar,
 and popping up the parameters of a monte carlo case by clicking on its
 data on a plot. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 OD Toolbox is not supposed to be: <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * A tightly-integrated, highly configuration-controlled, monolithic
 system. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * A replacement for high-fidelity operational ground or flight
 software. <br />

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 * A GUI-based ground support system for operational support. <br />
