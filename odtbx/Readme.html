<p>
<i>The Orbit Determination Toolbox Release 6.5 has been tested with MATLAB versions R2012a, R2012b, and R2013a. While parts of it may work with earlier versions of MATLAB, the results are not tested or guaranteed.</i>
<i>In conjunction with these MATLAB versions, the following operating systems have been tested: Windows 7, MacOS X 10.7, Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10.</i>
</p>

<p>In order to use the Orbit Determination Toolbox (ODTBX) Release 6.5 installer you 
must first download a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) if you don't already have one. 
You can also choose to download the JDK which includes the Runtime Environment, 
compilers and development tools.  You can download a JRE or JDK from: 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">www.oracle.com</a>. 
(Other flavors/variations of Java have not been tested with ODTBX and JAT.)
</p><br>

<ol>The ODTBX Release 6.5 Installer allows the user to install:<br><br>

<li><b>Orbit Determination Toolbox Release 6.5</b><br><br>

      Once the code is installed everything will be set up and ready to go. A new toolbox
      will be located inside of the MATLAB help browser known as "Orbit Determination 
      Toolbox". The only requirement for the ODTBX help is that you have MATLAB.<br><br>

      The ODTBX Help includes help documentation and code for the ODTBX. The MATLAB
      Java Astrodynamic Toolkit (JAT) Adaptor code is also included in this distribution.
      In order to use the JAT Adapter code you will need to also install the JAT release
      contained within this installer. The paths will already be set for the MATLAB/JAT 
      interface.

<li><b>Java Astrodynamic Toolkit</b><br><br>

      Release commit d44a587, created on Aug. 26, 2012. This JAT release is specific to ODTBX and can be accessed via <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/odtbx/git/ci/d44a587/tree/vendor/Jat/">the Git repository for this release.</a> </li><br>
      
      JAT will run on any platform, but requires a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
      of version of 1.7 or newer.

<li><b>Mice - the NAIF MATLAB interface to the SPICE toolkit</b><br><br>

      version N0064, released June 11, 2010</li><br>

      The Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) offers an information system 
      named "SPICE" to assist scientists in planning and interpreting scientific observations 
      from space-borne instruments. SPICE is also widely used in engineering tasks needing 
      access to space geometry.  MICE and SPICE can be downloaded from 
      <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html">http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html</a>.
