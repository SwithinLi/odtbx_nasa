        Orbit Determination Toolbox Instructions
                     for Removal

An ODTBX installation only affects two areas, this directory 
and the installing user's MATLAB startup.m file.  

To uninstall ODTBX there are only two steps.

1) During installation the startup.m file in 
   $MATLAB_HOME was overwritten 
   by the ODTBX installer.  If there were no user-specific
   additional modifications then simply delete this startup.m.

   WARNING: If any additional user-specific modifications were
   made after ODTBX installation and they need to be preserved
   then simply edit this startup.m to remove the ODTBX content 
   instead of deleting it.  

   The top of the ODTBX startup.m content is marked by:
   % ODTBX startup.m file

   The bottom of the ODTBX startup.m content is marked by:
   %
   % End-User Customization Goes Here:
   %

   Everyting in between should be specific to the ODTBX install.

2) Remove this entire ODTBX installation directory
   ($INSTALL_PATH)

   Note, some platforms won't let you delete this ODTBX directory while
   this file is being accessed.
