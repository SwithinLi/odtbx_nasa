  developed by NASA and private industry. We use an open source process to
  maximize tehcnology transfer and permit anyone to develop and validate new
  algorithms and to enable new algorithms to quickly transition into the high
  fidelity core.</p><p>GMAT is designed to model and optimize spacecraft trajectories in
  flight regimes ranging from low Earth orbit to lunar applications,
  interplanetary trajectories, and other deep space missions. The system
  supports constrained and unconstrained trajectory optimization and built-in
  features make defining cost and constraint functions trivial so analysts can
  determine how their inclusion or exclusion effects solutions.</p><p>The system also contains initial value solvers (propagation) and
  boundary value solvers and efficiently propagates spacecraft either singly
  or coupled. GMAT's propagators naturally synchronize the epochs of multiple
  vehicles and shorten run times by avoiding fixed step integration or
  interpolation to synchronize epochs of spacecraft.</p><p>A user can interact with GMAT using either a graphical user interface
  (GUI) or script language that has a syntax similar to the MathWorks'
  MATLAB&reg;1 system. All of the system elements can be expressed through either
  interface and users can configure elements in the GUI and then view the
  corresponding script, or write script and load it into GMAT.</p><p>Analysts model space missions in GMAT by first creating resources such
  as spacecraft, propagators, and optimizers to name a few. These resources
  can be configured to meet the needs of specific applications and missions.
  After the resources are configured they are used in the mission sequence to
  model the motion of spacecraft and simulate events in a mission's time
  evolution. The mission sequence supports commands such as Nonlinear
  Constraint, Minimize, Propagate, Function Calls, Inline Math, and Script
  Events among others.</p><p>The system can display trajectories in space, plot parameters against
  one another, and save parameters to files for later processing. The
  trajectory and plot capabilities are fully interactive, plotting data as a
  mission is run and allowing users to zoom into regions of interest.
  Trajectories and data can be viewed in any coordinate system defined in
  GMAT, and GMAT allows users to rotate the view and set the focus to any
  object in the display. The trajectory view can be animated so users can
  watch the evolution of the trajectory over time.</p><div class="section" title="Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N10063"></a>Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>The General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) is a software system
    designed to model and optimize spacecraft trajectories in flight regimes
    ranging from low Earth orbit to lunar applications, interplanetary
    trajectories, and other deep space missions. You simulate space missions
    in GMAT by first creating models of components such as spacecraft,
    propagators, and optimizers. GMAT contains an extensive set of available
    Resources that can be broken down into physical model Resources and
    analysis model Resources. Physical Resources include spacecraft, thruster,
    tank, ground station, formation, impulsive burn, finite burn, planet,
    comet, asteroid, to name a few. Analysis model Resources include
    differential corrector, propagator, optimizer, 3-D graphic, x-y plot,
    report, among many others.</p><p>After the resources are configured, they are used in the mission
    sequence to model spacecraft motion and simulate events in a mission&rsquo;s
    time evolution. Users employ built-in Commands that simulate trajectory
    dynamics or apply numerical methods such as estimators, optimizers, and
    boundary value solvers. The mission sequence supports many commands
    including, but not limited to, propagate, impulsive maneuver, finite
    maneuver, target, optimize, estimate, simulate measurements, non-linear
    constraint, minimize, call functions, inline math, vary parameter and
    control flow. The system can display trajectories in space, plot
    parameters against one another, and save parameters to files for later
    processing. The trajectory and plot capabilities are fully interactive,
    plotting data as a mission is run and allowing users to zoom in to regions
    of interest. Trajectories and data can be viewed in any coordinate system
    defined in GMAT, and GMAT allows users to rotate the view and set the
    focus to any object in the display. The trajectory view can be animated so
    users can watch the evolution of the trajectory over time.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="pt01.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="u" href="pt01.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="40%">Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Introduction&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td valign="top" align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;Licensing</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
